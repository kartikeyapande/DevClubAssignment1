Personally I feel DevCLub is innovative and will help me represent the ideas in term of actual projects or probably a rehersal on a smaller scale of the same.
That's the essence of developement to me that to develop products out of ideas and making people's life easier and that's what i believe and there's nothing wihtout a purpose and rather than this idealistic talk, the developement brings in the skills that are required in the real industry.
So i look onto the DevClub as a practice for the industry and to see whether developement really interests me.
